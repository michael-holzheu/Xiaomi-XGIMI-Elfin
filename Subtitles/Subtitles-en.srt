1
00:00:03,866 --> 00:00:13,999
So... So today we are going to test the “Video Projectors - Part 2”

2
00:00:13,999 --> 00:00:20,232
Here we have the Xiaomi Elfin.

3
00:00:20,232 --> 00:00:23,265
After we recently

4
00:00:23,265 --> 00:00:25,265
tested the

5
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:28,031
YouSonic

6
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:30,631
M2W and rated it

7
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:34,664
as not suitable

8
00:00:34,731 --> 00:00:36,231
.

9
00:00:36,764 --> 00:00:39,697
Now let's move on to the Chinese product.

10
00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:43,897
And let's unpack that now.

11
00:00:45,464 --> 00:00:46,764
So...

12
00:00:51,297 --> 00:00:53,330
Well, this looks very

13
00:00:54,797 --> 00:00:56,563
virginal.

14
00:00:56,563 --> 00:01:00,730
So I guess I'll be the first to unbox this device.

15
00:01:00,763 --> 00:01:04,229
At least this one...

16
00:01:05,896 --> 00:01:09,096
How does it work?

17
00:01:09,963 --> 00:01:18,595
(Sounds: opening package)

18
00:01:19,695 --> 00:01:23,628
First hurdle, first hurdle.

19
00:01:23,628 --> 00:01:27,062
But oh yeah, there's another...

20
00:01:30,295 --> 00:01:33,328
A piece of tape.

21
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:37,561
So Netflix,

22
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:39,961
Netflix, advertising!

23
00:01:41,994 --> 00:01:45,994
And here it is again...

24
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:50,860
Relatively compact.

25
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,060
The Beamer!

26
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:56,260
You can see a few connections at the back.

27
00:01:56,293 --> 00:01:58,260
Unfortunately, you can't really see it here.

28
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,960
I have to make the light better again.

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,660
Um, once USB-A.

30
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:08,093
Then electricity again here.

31
00:02:09,493 --> 00:02:10,126
What is that?

32
00:02:10,126 --> 00:02:14,659
It could be a small jack plug.

33
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:18,292
And HDMI, fans I assume.

34
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:22,359
On-off switch. And this, I've been looking forward to.

35
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:23,359
This is a

36
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:27,625
thread for a tripod!

37
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:31,125
Hopefully standard size. Yes,

38
00:02:32,592 --> 00:02:33,658
yes...

39
00:02:34,658 --> 00:02:37,791
Interestingly enough, no...

40
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,124
Um, no safety warnings.

41
00:02:41,524 --> 00:02:47,224
Danger group two, like the American model.

42
00:02:47,857 --> 00:02:51,191
Well, that's it then!

43
00:02:52,324 --> 00:02:55,790
Then we need electricity again, I suppose...

44
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,024
There we have... Oiii...

45
00:02:58,424 --> 00:03:00,923
An instruction manual!

46
00:03:00,923 --> 00:03:03,923
You don't see that very often these days.

47
00:03:03,923 --> 00:03:04,623
Let's leave it in,

48
00:03:04,623 --> 00:03:08,090
who knows, maybe it has to go back.

49
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,790
Then a small power supply,

50
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,656
small power supply.

51
00:03:13,656 --> 00:03:23,089
Not bad either.

52
00:03:23,089 --> 00:03:25,755
Whereby this now here again somehow from...

53
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:30,689
From the wiring

54
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:33,622
looks as if it was

55
00:03:34,355 --> 00:03:36,422
used before.

56
00:03:36,422 --> 00:03:38,055
Possibly...

57
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:45,521
Well, definitely very nice and small and light.

58
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:48,121
I like that.

59
00:03:48,254 --> 00:03:52,054
And the right plug, we

60
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:56,287
somehow forgot what it was called last time.

61
00:03:56,421 --> 00:04:00,254
We remember: So not the Euro plug, but the

62
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:06,087
European chocolate or safety plug.

63
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,786
Then we have here again the typical

64
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,786
Mickey Mouse

65
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:17,419
connection for

66
00:04:18,186 --> 00:04:23,186
the device plug.

67
00:04:24,052 --> 00:04:25,552
Yes!

68
00:04:26,986 --> 00:04:29,186
Then here

69
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,719
's the remote control.

70
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:45,018
(Sounds: unpacking)

71
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,385
And then I read in the test reports

72
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:49,684
that this is somehow a special

73
00:04:50,751 --> 00:04:53,118
operation of the XGIMI.

74
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:02,450
Do we have to open now, here!

75
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,317
And here

76
00:05:11,317 --> 00:05:14,516
, interestingly, no batteries!

77
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,716
Which

78
00:05:18,316 --> 00:05:21,316
of course brings both advantages and disadvantages.

79
00:05:21,316 --> 00:05:25,349
Probably good for the environment! Bad for those

80
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:30,516
who don't have batteries at home at the moment!

81
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:33,216
But I think I found some...

82
00:05:43,082 --> 00:05:46,048
Found them!

83
00:05:53,548 --> 00:05:55,781
So batteries!

84
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:09,647
Alright, filled!

85
00:06:09,647 --> 00:06:12,847
So, pretty small.

86
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:18,513
And everything back (again)!

87
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,546
That completes the first part!

88
00:06:31,446 --> 00:06:33,646
And that means

89
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:37,712
the power is coming!

90
00:06:37,945 --> 00:06:40,412
That's almost a bit short, isn't it? Let's see if it's enough... It

91
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:42,879
will be enough!

92
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:45,178
It will be enough for this test!

93
00:06:46,312 --> 00:06:49,645
So the current

94
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:55,178
must go into the right socket!

95
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:55,811
bang!

96
00:06:57,078 --> 00:06:58,178
is in!

97
00:06:58,444 --> 00:07:02,911
Yes, and then we can start, I think, we can switch it on.

98
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:07,011
So with these LED projectors, at least as far as I know...

99
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:11,744
They are not so susceptible to vibrations because the LED

100
00:07:12,777 --> 00:07:14,577
is robust.

101
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,243
So, probably stay longer

102
00:07:17,243 --> 00:07:19,643
until this comes up, right?

103
00:07:20,477 --> 00:07:24,243
Why isn't it working?

104
00:07:25,676 --> 00:07:27,576
Well, that was clear...

105
00:07:27,843 --> 00:07:29,109
Well, of course that's again...

106
00:07:29,976 --> 00:07:33,009
Short cable!

107
00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:35,842
So!

108
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:39,442
Very short cable...

109
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:41,442
So, okay!

110
00:07:43,142 --> 00:07:45,542
Ah yes, now it starts!

111
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:48,975
Significantly quieter than...

112
00:07:49,842 --> 00:07:55,208
Significantly quieter than the ViewSonic colleague!

113
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,475
But a lot!

114
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:02,508
You hardly hear it now.

115
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:06,208
Now it's getting even quieter, let's see the startup again for a moment!

116
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:13,807
Just turn it off again!

117
00:08:15,174 --> 00:08:16,574
The question is how do you turn it off?

118
00:08:16,574 --> 00:08:19,440
So you can see here: It's on!

119
00:08:21,207 --> 00:08:22,840
He is still "booting".

120
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:33,173
(Sounds: music)

121
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,973
(Sounds: Michael laughs)

122
00:08:38,206 --> 00:08:46,272
Nice music!

123
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:49,305
Actually I want to turn it off again.

124
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:51,639
Double-click, ahh double-click!

125
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:55,005
Double-clicking will probably turn it off.

126
00:09:01,305 --> 00:09:05,804
Hmm, fan is still running...

127
00:09:08,438 --> 00:09:14,404
stay on longer?

128
00:09:14,404 --> 00:09:15,871
hmm

129
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:17,604
Ah, now it's out!

130
00:09:18,437 --> 00:09:20,770
So let's try turning it on again.

131
00:09:22,137 --> 00:09:32,570
(Sounds: coughing)

132
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,936
Very bright.

133
00:09:43,602 --> 00:09:45,969
Now the music comes on again. Now we need to somehow

134
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:52,669
configure the remote control.

135
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:53,602
So here...

136
00:09:55,069 --> 00:10:00,602
press the cottage button.

137
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:05,701
And see what happens!

138
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:08,335
Press it now!

139
00:10:08,335 --> 00:10:09,168
Nothing happens!

140
00:10:11,034 --> 00:10:11,934
Again!

141
00:10:13,068 --> 00:10:15,534
Ah yes. And maybe after this

142
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:18,834
arrow here, which strangely enough

143
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:23,834
is shown here as a "backward arrow"

144
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:26,600
and in the display as a "left arrow".

145
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:31,200
Nothing happens either, why?

146
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:34,567
Ah, probably because I'm here for now, no!

147
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:37,233
Is an on and off switch.

148
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:40,566
hmm But actually I have it now...

149
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,533
The batteries inserted correctly.

150
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:45,966
That's why I don't quite understand

151
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:47,932
why this isn't working now.

152
00:10:47,932 --> 00:10:49,699
He says four inches!

153
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:53,166
Ten centimeters. Well, that's actually what we are...

154
00:10:55,665 --> 00:10:57,332
Ten centimeters...

155
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,398
In front or behind?

156
00:11:02,765 --> 00:11:05,598
I do not know either.

157
00:11:08,365 --> 00:11:13,398
So check again if I inserted the batteries correctly.

158
00:11:13,398 --> 00:11:16,931
But actually I thought they were right in there.

159
00:11:20,231 --> 00:11:22,364
Are also right in it in the right...

160
00:11:22,364 --> 00:11:23,131
(direction).

161
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:24,664
But maybe there was some protection...

162
00:11:24,664 --> 00:11:27,797
No!

163
00:11:27,797 --> 00:11:36,763
looks ok

164
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:39,463
Now try again.

165
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,730
So what is he saying here?

166
00:11:42,063 --> 00:11:44,463
Ten centimeters.

167
00:11:44,463 --> 00:11:46,663
And then maybe you should press both at the same time?

168
00:11:46,696 --> 00:11:49,463
You might be able to do that now.

169
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:55,396
Ah yes, you had to press both at the same time.

170
00:11:56,662 --> 00:12:00,095
So and now the car says Keystone in progress...

171
00:12:00,295 --> 00:12:04,195
Correction failed. Adjust distance or check.

172
00:12:04,195 --> 00:12:07,628
Ah yes. Now he probably has to make sure that he...

173
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,528
Auto Keystone...

174
00:12:10,528 --> 00:12:16,628
Yes... Great, it does everything automatically right away!

175
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:21,928
Yes, at least he tries!

176
00:12:22,694 --> 00:12:25,894
Because now we've got it crooked and now he's trying to straighten it out.

177
00:12:25,894 --> 00:12:28,927
And because I'm holding it and shaking it, he probably

178
00:12:28,927 --> 00:12:30,360
wo n't come right now...

179
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,994
Can't he get it!

180
00:12:31,994 --> 00:12:39,627
So, I'll just put the device in the right position.

181
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:42,826
I have to kinda...

182
00:12:42,926 --> 00:12:46,460
put something underneath it now because unlike the

183
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,026
ViewSonic... opps sorry!

184
00:12:49,026 --> 00:12:50,693
Unlike the ViewSonic...

185
00:12:51,926 --> 00:12:54,559
this device doesn't have a stand here.

186
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:58,326
That means you have to do it somehow...

187
00:12:59,026 --> 00:13:00,759
somehow.

188
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:06,792
But that's not a real problem now.

189
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:09,558
We'll get there at some point.

190
00:13:09,558 --> 00:13:11,358
This is small now,

191
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,592
try again here.

192
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:18,691
So both at the same time.

193
00:13:18,691 --> 00:13:20,025
I'm making a video...

194
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:22,024
(roommate: Oh, I have to be quiet)

195
00:13:24,224 --> 00:13:25,858
Well, that's not possible with either of them.

196
00:13:25,858 --> 00:13:28,191
Why? Ten centimeters?

197
00:13:33,524 --> 00:13:36,790
Ummm... you don't do it? Please come, stop now!

198
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,090
Infant!

199
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,790
stay on it?

200
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:46,423
double click?

201
00:13:46,423 --> 00:13:48,256
Ah yes, double click, worked!

202
00:13:48,256 --> 00:13:51,756
I don't know if that's really what it was now.

203
00:13:51,756 --> 00:13:54,289
So, now we have... Let

204
00:13:55,456 --> 00:13:56,623
's set the language.

205
00:13:56,623 --> 00:13:59,356
So first of all

206
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:04,189
, I like the setup better than with the

207
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:08,822
ViewSonic M2W! Set up

208
00:14:10,489 --> 00:14:12,189
your TV using your Android

209
00:14:12,189 --> 00:14:14,288
smartphone

210
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:19,621
You can easily set up your TV's Wi-Fi and Google...

211
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:23,755
You can easily set up your TV's Wi-Fi and Google

212
00:14:23,855 --> 00:14:27,388
account credentials.

213
00:14:27,421 --> 00:14:28,488
We'll do that later!

214
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:32,521
Let's do standard now! First we select the WLAN

215
00:14:34,787 --> 00:14:37,221
Again our “muckelnet”...

216
00:14:37,521 --> 00:14:43,254
Hide password...

217
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:52,320
Let's just have a look here first...

218
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:05,686
On the keyboard...

219
00:15:05,686 --> 00:15:12,352
If you want to enter the special characters, then you have to go here

220
00:15:15,219 --> 00:15:17,852
just press this middle button longer just press

221
00:15:17,852 --> 00:15:18,352
this middle button longer...

222
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:21,018
And then you get to the special characters!

223
00:15:21,018 --> 00:15:22,652
bang!

224
00:15:29,784 --> 00:15:32,284
Yes, now I have the problem

225
00:15:33,318 --> 00:15:37,284
that I can't find a question mark on the keyboard.

226
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:39,751
Why?

227
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,050
So whatever is possible...

228
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,850
Here you can switch

229
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:55,150
from numbers to

230
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,016
characters

231
00:15:58,783 --> 00:16:01,849
or numbers!

232
00:16:01,849 --> 00:16:04,316
And then you also get the corresponding special characters,

233
00:16:04,316 --> 00:16:07,383
so most of them at least probably.

234
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:11,282
So I enter again, from the beginning.

235
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:17,849
I like the keyboard

236
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:25,515
. So, now I'm done!

237
00:16:25,515 --> 00:16:28,481
And now?

238
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:30,581
Now I'm done with the password.

239
00:16:30,581 --> 00:16:34,114
I think I entered it correctly too. And now I have to press OK.

240
00:16:34,114 --> 00:16:38,214
I assume that this is supposed to be this “next button”.

241
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:39,448
I assume that this is supposed to be this “next button”.
Yes!

242
00:16:42,147 --> 00:16:43,381
Well, we're connected!

243
00:16:52,214 --> 00:16:56,113
So on the sound is surprisingly good, really.

244
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:57,747
I like it!

245
00:16:59,047 --> 00:17:07,313
(Sounds: music)

246
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:14,679
Well, the connection could have been a little quicker.

247
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:16,846
So, make the best use of it!

248
00:17:16,846 --> 00:17:19,745
Now I would have to log into my Google Play because it has

249
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,712
an Android operating system,

250
00:17:23,379 --> 00:17:25,645
this thing!

251
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,312
Alright, let's do it then!

252
00:17:29,012 --> 00:17:30,945
Then we'll get in touch with you soon!

253
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:41,211
So we do the Google registration.

254
00:17:41,444 --> 00:17:43,378
It will then work again...

255
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:57,877
probably enter the password right

256
00:18:09,343 --> 00:18:11,543
away 80 percent probability

257
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:16,709
that I entered it correctly.

258
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:19,109
So let's see! And off we go!

259
00:18:20,076 --> 00:18:22,642
Oh wrong button!

260
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:23,342
We can still do that here.

261
00:18:23,342 --> 00:18:25,309
Oh yes, by the way:

262
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:30,042
Here you can probably navigate forwards and backwards with the password.

263
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,308
Very nice!

264
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:35,575
Of course it didn't work! Oh man!

265
00:18:35,575 --> 00:18:40,341
Enter again!

266
00:18:40,408 --> 00:18:43,708
On this occasion one can of course ask oneself

267
00:18:44,974 --> 00:18:48,674
how many million hours of lifetime

268
00:18:50,374 --> 00:18:50,907
have already been

269
00:18:51,341 --> 00:18:55,874
burned by entering a password?

270
00:18:57,574 --> 00:19:03,373
So now we've got it right!

271
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:06,873
So, for better protection, we need to check.

272
00:19:06,873 --> 00:19:13,240
That means a release should

273
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,973
have come on one of my devices, yes!

274
00:19:18,973 --> 00:19:20,506
No!

275
00:19:22,272 --> 00:19:27,339
OK, did that work now?

276
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:35,105
So now came here: Connection could not be established.

277
00:19:35,105 --> 00:19:37,772
Oh dear, that was clear!

278
00:19:38,338 --> 00:19:42,605
So, da da da, must remove everything!

279
00:19:43,671 --> 00:19:46,304
So send us one more time

280
00:19:47,304 --> 00:19:51,438
And now we come to this: Now comes this registration... (Confirm registration attempt)

281
00:19:51,438 --> 00:19:54,904
And I have to say: Yes, that was me!

282
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,204
Agree to the terms of use?

283
00:20:02,204 --> 00:20:04,070
Yes of course, always!

284
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,937
Oh, I haven't even pressed it yet...

285
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,303
Voice control.

286
00:20:09,303 --> 00:20:11,636
Oh dear, I don't really want to do that...

287
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,803
Recommend...

288
00:20:13,803 --> 00:20:16,970
Da da da, go on, it doesn't matter!

289
00:20:17,103 --> 00:20:21,603
Search your TV apps, search...

290
00:20:21,903 --> 00:20:25,269
Hmm, search all your TV apps

291
00:20:26,302 --> 00:20:27,436
.

292
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:30,169
To do this, you must allow Google

293
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:33,869
to share your requests with your TV's apps. or?

294
00:20:34,135 --> 00:20:36,302
Oh, let's leave that for now!

295
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,102
Okay, data protection and so on...

296
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:41,935
Get the most out of it?

297
00:20:41,935 --> 00:20:44,335
No, definitely not

298
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:51,468
the usage, right?

299
00:20:51,468 --> 00:20:54,168
Why again terms of use?

300
00:20:54,168 --> 00:20:57,001
Ok location?

301
00:20:57,001 --> 00:20:57,634
No!

302
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:00,134
No!

303
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:02,334
Voice Control...

304
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:05,367
We just had that! How often do we do this?

305
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,700
Privacy!

306
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,334
Get

307
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,300
Personal Experiences

308
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,700
again ? No!

309
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:13,367
No! Use optimally?

310
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:14,567
No!

311
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,800
Install more apps?

312
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,233
Not at first!

313
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,466
Continue!

314
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,432
Powered by Android! Here you will get to know the functions.

315
00:21:31,432 --> 00:21:33,066
OK!

316
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:35,265
We can download apps.

317
00:21:35,265 --> 00:21:36,365
Sure, of course!

318
00:21:37,265 --> 00:21:41,365
Talk to the Google Assistant... That means the "Projector",

319
00:21:42,665 --> 00:21:46,398
the Beamer, as they say in German,

320
00:21:47,165 --> 00:21:50,131
can obviously have voice control!

321
00:21:51,865 --> 00:21:53,198
And we can stream,

322
00:21:53,198 --> 00:21:58,231
like with the ViewSonic model, where we unfortunately tried it with AirPlay without success...

323
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:01,464
Unfortunately unsuccessfully with

324
00:22:02,097 --> 00:22:05,831
AirPlay, it can also stream! So Android has

325
00:22:05,831 --> 00:22:09,930
I think it has a similar function. I haven't used it myself though.

326
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:14,797
Image correction automatically... Let's skip everything!

327
00:22:14,797 --> 00:22:18,530
It all looks pretty good, doesn't it?

328
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,530
Image sharpness you can maybe watch again.

329
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,263
Slide the bottom switch

330
00:22:24,196 --> 00:22:27,896
to the right to enable auto focus.

331
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:31,529
If it doesn't work effectively, press plus to

332
00:22:31,963 --> 00:22:33,962
manually adjust the focus.

333
00:22:33,962 --> 00:22:35,229
So what should I do?

334
00:22:37,362 --> 00:22:39,362
Slide the bottom switch...

335
00:22:39,362 --> 00:22:42,662
Slide the bottom switch to the right to

336
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:45,229
open the... Oh, the bottom switch!

337
00:22:46,028 --> 00:22:47,562
Well, that one lower switch,

338
00:22:48,662 --> 00:22:50,528
it's currently...

339
00:22:51,128 --> 00:22:55,795
it's kind of hard to see here, isn't it?

340
00:22:55,795 --> 00:22:57,361
Another camera

341
00:22:57,361 --> 00:23:00,161
where you can see it better.

342
00:23:01,861 --> 00:23:03,261
Also not good!

343
00:23:03,261 --> 00:23:05,761
I need another close-up camera!

344
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:06,561
Soon!

345
00:23:07,661 --> 00:23:10,261
So, there's a switch here.

346
00:23:10,261 --> 00:23:16,060
Unfortunately, you can't see that clearly here.

347
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,927
There 's a switch that's

348
00:23:17,927 --> 00:23:21,260
currently open...

349
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,126
So here's a switch that

350
00:23:25,126 --> 00:23:28,393
's currently open...

351
00:23:28,393 --> 00:23:29,560
What's that called?

352
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:36,726
VOL, so the left position of the switch and the right one is focus.

353
00:23:36,726 --> 00:23:40,626
And he says focus here... Manually.

354
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:43,159
So if the autofocus doesn't work,

355
00:23:44,025 --> 00:23:47,159
you should switch it to manual and focus

356
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:50,525
probably means manual, but let's stick with autofocus!

357
00:23:51,192 --> 00:23:55,858
So we don't need that now and then go back with the button here.

358
00:23:56,258 --> 00:23:59,758
I'll take a look and we'll just skip it for now, it's all just

359
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:03,091
fine tuning, you can always do it later.

360
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:04,924
So now we're done.

361
00:24:04,924 --> 00:24:06,891
Probably with the configuration.

362
00:24:06,891 --> 00:24:08,458
There is a system update.

363
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:12,991
That's always the same with today's devices.

364
00:24:14,724 --> 00:24:16,990
Of course we don't want one now, do we?

365
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,990
Do we want to do a system update?

366
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:24,323
Conclude.

367
00:24:24,323 --> 00:24:29,556
So, now let's do the picture so that it's really complete...

368
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,056
Put things down!

369
00:24:35,589 --> 00:24:38,256
So, right now...

370
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:43,789
Well, you can already hear it running...

371
00:24:46,222 --> 00:24:47,889
And I've got

372
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:52,355
the ceiling light on now! Also an LED light!

373
00:24:53,655 --> 00:24:56,455
Position the whole thing a bit more so

374
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:00,055
that it is exactly in the middle.

375
00:25:00,055 --> 00:25:03,855
Ah yes, I messed it up. Now he's probably trying to recalibrate

376
00:25:04,888 --> 00:25:06,621
as much as he can, yep!

377
00:25:06,621 --> 00:25:10,788
OK! Yes, very nice! And that also looks like he

378
00:25:11,821 --> 00:25:14,854
has a zoom.

379
00:25:14,854 --> 00:25:17,487
But fine, please adjust.

380
00:25:17,487 --> 00:25:20,920
Okay, I actually want to leave it like that for now, short!

381
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,554
Press to reset, return.

382
00:25:24,554 --> 00:25:26,153
I think we'll leave that for now!

383
00:25:26,153 --> 00:25:26,953
So again!

384
00:25:26,953 --> 00:25:30,253
We currently have the lamp,

385
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,220
the ceiling light on here and if I turn it off, you can see it better, yes!

386
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,419
It's not overly bright now, the...

387
00:25:39,686 --> 00:25:42,053
light from the projector.

388
00:25:43,353 --> 00:25:44,952
But good...

389
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:47,719
Then let's try YouTube, shall we? First of all...

390
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,652
play the movie!

391
00:25:49,652 --> 00:25:51,719
If we already have something like that...

392
00:25:58,985 --> 00:26:06,018
Yes, then we'll take our account!

393
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:11,951
So what could we play? Ahmm...

394
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:16,751
Can I find my own? My own...

395
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:17,951
Now it's kind of...

396
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,351
Ohh, he's a bit slow!

397
00:26:20,484 --> 00:26:22,784
So you can switch accounts. But I didn't want to go there!

398
00:26:22,784 --> 00:26:28,817
I actually wanted to find my own films. Ah, we already have something!

399
00:26:29,983 --> 00:26:32,883
ViewSonic... Okay, those were the old ones!

400
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,217
Ah yes!

401
00:26:35,217 --> 00:26:39,683
We can now simply look for my ViewSonic film from...

402
00:26:41,983 --> 00:26:43,683
ViewSonic...

403
00:26:44,283 --> 00:26:57,382
...!

404
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,949
So where is the "N"? Oh my!

405
00:27:04,315 --> 00:27:06,048
Yes, no, but can also be a space, right?

406
00:27:06,048 --> 00:27:09,281
Where's the space?

407
00:27:09,281 --> 00:27:11,448
That's probably the hyphen though, isn't it?

408
00:27:11,748 --> 00:27:13,615
space is here!

409
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:14,948
ViewSonic...

410
00:27:15,314 --> 00:27:19,048
what did we say? M2W!

411
00:27:24,047 --> 00:27:27,447
There's not that much out there yet, that's why I did it!

412
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:31,280
Because I thought...

413
00:27:32,014 --> 00:27:34,813
That's another...

414
00:27:34,813 --> 00:27:38,780
No, that's what we did just recently, so "M2W"!

415
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,180
Then let's see what he brings!

416
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,713
(Movie: ViewSonic Smart LED Projector)

417
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:51,979
(Movie: With Harman Kardon Sound On Board)

418
00:27:52,979 --> 00:27:55,246
coffin on board?

419
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:07,612
(Movie: And here we have the M2W)

420
00:28:07,612 --> 00:28:12,078
(Movie: This is one of the three types)

421
00:28:12,811 --> 00:28:15,145
(Movie: This projector you can buy)

422
00:28:15,145 --> 00:28:19,911
(Movie: And two of the brightest)

423
00:28:19,911 --> 00:28:22,344
(Movie: 1700 lumens)

424
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:28,677
(Movie: And... Yes, now let's see what the device can do)

425
00:28:29,644 --> 00:28:32,844
(Movie: Before we find out, maybe we should just check it out)

426
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,777
(Movie: unpack it!)

427
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:38,610
Yes, so it runs smoothly!

428
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,010
It's actually pretty bright!

429
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:45,843
Bright enough for my small space for sure!

430
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:51,443
And as I said, the fan is acceptable!

431
00:28:52,209 --> 00:28:54,509
(Movie: already positive and compact)

432
00:28:54,643 --> 00:28:59,876
It feels a bit smaller than this ViewSonic...

433
00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:03,509
I would actually say that quite clearly!

434
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,842
(Movie: Possibilities USB-C) That's okay!

435
00:29:05,842 --> 00:29:07,909
And we don't have USB-C, unfortunately.

436
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:13,242
This is actually a disadvantage here! I think so...

437
00:29:13,308 --> 00:29:16,441
At least a small disadvantage.

438
00:29:16,441 --> 00:29:17,275
So then...

439
00:29:17,275 --> 00:29:20,775
So next thing is now... Let's just...

440
00:29:21,141 --> 00:29:28,208
connect the newly set up windows laptop,

441
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:32,341
the surface laptop (studio).

442
00:29:32,841 --> 00:29:37,040
Of course it only has USB-C, which means we need an adapter again...

443
00:29:38,074 --> 00:29:40,774
I have that somewhere too...

444
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,740
(Sounds: Michael singing)

445
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:54,206
Well, which is also interesting... Of course!

446
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:57,106
That there was no USB cable with the projector...

447
00:29:58,139 --> 00:30:00,973
But that doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing, because you have...

448
00:30:01,906 --> 00:30:05,872
now at least... Everyone has at least about 500...

449
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:08,739
Every technology freak has at least 500 of them Cables,

450
00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:14,372
cables like that at home and I now have an

451
00:30:14,738 --> 00:30:17,105
adapter from USB-C

452
00:30:18,038 --> 00:30:23,705
to USB-A here, the old USB connector format.

453
00:30:23,705 --> 00:30:28,438
Of course, this is no longer USB-A in that sense, but also...

454
00:30:28,438 --> 00:30:31,838
USB 3! So USB-A, 3, we have to clarify that again,

455
00:30:32,071 --> 00:30:34,071
the different...

456
00:30:35,304 --> 00:30:37,571
The different...

457
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:42,370
protocols, they're called USB protocols!

458
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:45,070
Well, unfortunately the cable is too short.

459
00:30:46,004 --> 00:30:48,970
Oh God, um...

460
00:30:49,237 --> 00:30:51,503
Yes, then we'll have to postpone everything again for a moment.

461
00:30:51,503 --> 00:30:55,270
A little...

462
00:30:56,503 --> 00:30:59,969
So where's my USB plug?

463
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:03,369
Here, but that probably won't happen.

464
00:31:03,703 --> 00:31:08,402
This probably won't do anything, because I suppose that need HDMI

465
00:31:08,936 --> 00:31:12,469
and not USB! But try it anyway,

466
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:14,702
even if I don't think it will work...

467
00:31:15,835 --> 00:31:20,368
Oh, now of course I need a USB adapter on the other side...

468
00:31:20,602 --> 00:31:25,168
No, that works better! I also have a cable that

469
00:31:25,168 --> 00:31:28,768
goes from USB-C to USB-C.

470
00:31:29,735 --> 00:31:32,134
That is here!

471
00:31:33,134 --> 00:31:34,968
I suppose that won't work though

472
00:31:34,968 --> 00:31:41,901
because I don't think the image will work via USB-C...

473
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:45,267
Via USB-C, I just don't think that...

474
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,733
will work via USB-C! i.e. via the standard USB.

475
00:31:53,733 --> 00:31:57,600
That will not work!

476
00:31:58,866 --> 00:32:01,233
I urgently need an office people really urgently!

477
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,799
Urgently an office... So!

478
00:32:05,699 --> 00:32:08,699
Space is running out here!

479
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:17,565
And then we just have to recalibrate it again! Make new!

480
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:21,599
Well, we're going to get that sorted out now somehow...

481
00:32:24,598 --> 00:32:27,665
So, wait a minute! Here is the remote control.

482
00:32:28,898 --> 00:32:31,531
To restore...

483
00:32:31,531 --> 00:32:34,631
To restore I have to press this! Restore...

484
00:32:35,098 --> 00:32:41,464
default setting! Let's try default settings...

485
00:32:41,464 --> 00:32:44,731
I just want you to do this again like before!

486
00:32:44,831 --> 00:32:50,830
Why do not you do it? I want you now...

487
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,564
You did everything automatically before, why don't you do it now?

488
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:55,897
Probably up.

489
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:00,430
And settings...

490
00:33:00,796 --> 00:33:02,863
Muckelnet...

491
00:33:02,863 --> 00:33:05,663
Remote control ... Alright

492
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,896
, I think I...

493
00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:10,563
How do I fix that now?

494
00:33:10,563 --> 00:33:12,229
Home, home, home...

495
00:33:21,862 --> 00:33:24,395
entrances, what do we have? HDMI!

496
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:29,795
So actually we can forget that with USB, I think...

497
00:33:29,795 --> 00:33:32,828
So it was clear that it wouldn't work!

498
00:33:32,861 --> 00:33:33,661
So I think that...

499
00:33:36,095 --> 00:33:37,961
The only...

500
00:33:38,961 --> 00:33:40,461
possible...

501
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:44,228
video input for the projector...

502
00:33:44,228 --> 00:33:47,627
will be HDMI!

503
00:33:47,627 --> 00:33:51,161
I need an HDMI cable now, it's in the next room.

504
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,427
and I have to

505
00:33:55,794 --> 00:33:58,793
reconfigure everything here again.

506
00:34:09,326 --> 00:34:14,993
So, we've now found an HDMI cable... Let's turn on the lights again!

507
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,259
Found an HDMI cable.

508
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:20,992
Now we need...

509
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:24,859
another adapter!

510
00:34:25,592 --> 00:34:31,425
Namely an adapter from USB-C to HDMI...

511
00:34:32,425 --> 00:34:35,425
Because the laptop only has USB-C!

512
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:40,791
And I had this adapter somewhere, where is it?

513
00:34:51,991 --> 00:34:52,757
Menno...

514
00:34:54,157 --> 00:34:56,290
It was somewhere...

515
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,890
Maybe this one here?

516
00:35:05,223 --> 00:35:07,457
Ah yes...

517
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:15,056
we'll help you again when the opportunity arises... that's me

518
00:35:15,056 --> 00:35:18,423
Well, of course this is rubbish here, I have to be honest!

519
00:35:19,689 --> 00:35:22,322
My setup still leaves a lot to be desired,

520
00:35:22,322 --> 00:35:26,022
but I promise it will get better soon! I promise now!

521
00:35:27,389 --> 00:35:31,422
So what we, what I have now... Which doesn't do me any good...

522
00:35:31,422 --> 00:35:33,022
But it does exactly that!

523
00:35:33,022 --> 00:35:34,888
So I have a hub here, a

524
00:35:35,288 --> 00:35:38,888
USB hub that has USB-C on one side.

525
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:40,688
So this is the latest USB

526
00:35:41,088 --> 00:35:43,721
technology, the latest USB connector, which

527
00:35:44,255 --> 00:35:46,555
the European Union is also promoting.

528
00:35:46,755 --> 00:35:50,621
And on the side we have... HDMI, where the

529
00:35:50,621 --> 00:35:55,421
HDMI cable fits in and the HDMI cable is on both sides...

530
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:58,754
Has the same plug and it then fits

531
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,554
into the beamer into the projector, in English...

532
00:36:03,554 --> 00:36:04,854
Then he fits in!

533
00:36:04,854 --> 00:36:07,853
So here's the connection...

534
00:36:07,853 --> 00:36:10,687
And now with USB-C...

535
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,653
into the projector!

536
00:36:14,653 --> 00:36:21,119
Oh no, nonsense! With HDMI in the projector...

537
00:36:23,353 --> 00:36:28,919
Do I actually have a setting for it now?

538
00:36:32,285 --> 00:36:38,085
Well, now we have the projector here, I have a great...

539
00:36:38,785 --> 00:36:39,618
bridge here!

540
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:43,818
And then we put in here...

541
00:36:44,518 --> 00:36:46,918
the HDMI connector!

542
00:36:52,018 --> 00:36:53,751
Let's leave it like that for now.

543
00:36:55,684 --> 00:36:58,451
And on the other side,

544
00:36:58,784 --> 00:37:03,851
as I said, in the laptop, that's where the USB-C connection comes in.

545
00:37:03,851 --> 00:37:08,884
So and he noticed, something has happened...

546
00:37:09,117 --> 00:37:12,350
Now he says HDMI, very nice!

547
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:15,783
And then...

548
00:37:16,183 --> 00:37:18,283
So, now we have to briefly...

549
00:37:20,716 --> 00:37:22,416
bring the...

550
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:26,549
Windows computer into the picture!

551
00:37:26,549 --> 00:37:28,783
Yes, very nice!

552
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:32,349
Now let

553
00:37:33,582 --> 00:37:36,082
's see... All right ...

554
00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:38,149
What do we see?

555
00:37:38,149 --> 00:37:40,082
We have now...

556
00:37:40,949 --> 00:37:43,248
Well, apart from the fact that

557
00:37:43,948 --> 00:37:46,482
the image is unfortunately not calibrated properly.

558
00:37:48,148 --> 00:37:49,948
We now have to calibrate that again briefly.

559
00:37:49,948 --> 00:37:50,748
How does it work?

560
00:37:50,748 --> 00:37:53,315
I'll hit settings now.

561
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:56,248
It does not work! Ah "Home" I must definitely do.

562
00:37:56,614 --> 00:37:57,781
Home...

563
00:37:57,781 --> 00:38:00,881
And now I'd like to just do this...

564
00:38:04,147 --> 00:38:05,147
Device Settings...

565
00:38:05,147 --> 00:38:10,014
Projector Settings I guess! Keystone correction, focus...

566
00:38:10,514 --> 00:38:15,547
First of all, focus, automatic image sharpness...

567
00:38:15,747 --> 00:38:19,080
No, I didn't want focus, I actually wanted...

568
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,646
keystone correction!

569
00:38:21,646 --> 00:38:24,780
Automatically! Okay, now let's try to do this automatically.

570
00:38:25,913 --> 00:38:30,546
That was automatic... auto keystone! Ah yes very nice...

571
00:38:30,546 --> 00:38:34,279
Great! Great! Very nice...

572
00:38:35,712 --> 00:38:38,479
So we managed it!

573
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:42,012
And now I want to go back to HDMI...

574
00:38:42,012 --> 00:38:45,112
Inputs, I'm going to HDMI.

575
00:38:45,112 --> 00:38:45,912
Excellent!

576
00:38:46,445 --> 00:38:49,845
So, and now we actually have exactly the picture

577
00:38:51,445 --> 00:38:52,945
that you have on the Windows!

578
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:57,111
Worked great, now let's see... Ah it has a delay!

579
00:38:57,278 --> 00:38:58,278
So if I...

580
00:38:59,878 --> 00:39:01,244
move...

581
00:39:01,244 --> 00:39:02,344
bang!

582
00:39:02,344 --> 00:39:06,044
It'll take a while for that to get here.

583
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:09,111
That's a noticeable...

584
00:39:13,744 --> 00:39:15,944
time lag.

585
00:39:15,944 --> 00:39:16,910
Alright.

586
00:39:16,944 --> 00:39:20,243
So... Well...

587
00:39:20,877 --> 00:39:22,610
So, and then...

588
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,577
What did I want to show you?

589
00:39:24,577 --> 00:39:25,910
Exactly, a video.

590
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:29,876
We wanted to watch the same video as last time

591
00:39:29,876 --> 00:39:34,176
with the ViewSonic.

592
00:39:34,243 --> 00:39:37,409
Terminator Tennis!

593
00:39:41,276 --> 00:39:43,842
But at least it

594
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:47,309
feels a little smoother, like with ViewSonic.

595
00:39:47,309 --> 00:39:50,442
So as I said, but with a little time lag!

596
00:39:50,442 --> 00:39:51,975
That's it... Hmm, okay...

597
00:39:53,742 --> 00:39:57,841
And now let's play it!

598
00:39:57,841 --> 00:40:03,308
Interestingly enough, the sound comes first via the...

599
00:40:03,641 --> 00:40:05,341
Via the PC!

600
00:40:06,074 --> 00:40:09,908
Now we have to see if we can get that from the PC to the projector.

601
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,574
How did that work again on Windows?

602
00:40:11,574 --> 00:40:14,307
We'll probably have to...

603
00:40:14,741 --> 00:40:15,874
settings, how did that work?

604
00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:20,474
I've been working with the Mac all the time now... wait, I didn't want to go there!

605
00:40:22,307 --> 00:40:24,873
Moment!

606
00:40:25,073 --> 00:40:28,473
So, I'm okay right now, we can play this.

607
00:40:28,473 --> 00:40:31,840
The sound is usually also transmitted via HDMI,

608
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,906
which means that we now have to somehow

609
00:40:34,906 --> 00:40:37,906
or Windows I have down here the.

610
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:45,406
Yes, my roommate has problems with electrosmog

611
00:40:45,472 --> 00:40:48,072
and electro-sensitive in general.

612
00:40:48,772 --> 00:40:52,205
That means I'll have to think about what we're going to do there soon.

613
00:40:53,539 --> 00:40:54,972
But now I wanted

614
00:40:54,972 --> 00:40:59,072
first and foremost the sound, actually the sound...

615
00:41:00,738 --> 00:41:03,038
somehow redirected to the...

616
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:05,538
new device.

617
00:41:05,538 --> 00:41:06,805
How are you?

618
00:41:06,805 --> 00:41:10,404
There's sound here... Can you turn it off... on and off!

619
00:41:10,404 --> 00:41:13,771
Ah yes, and here you click on it... Hm, that's interesting!

620
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,971
I can't do it now...

621
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:18,137
Don't switch to the projector.

622
00:41:18,137 --> 00:41:20,171
Why not?

623
00:41:22,604 --> 00:41:24,137
That's...

624
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:28,637
maybe somehow possible, but at least ad hoc it's not possible.

625
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,037
Maybe it's also my adapter...

626
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:35,136
But I need it because my laptop

627
00:41:35,136 --> 00:41:36,970
doesn't have a direct HDMI connection.

628
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:40,136
Well, then we don't have that now.

629
00:41:40,136 --> 00:41:42,669
But now let's just play it like this, without the sound.

630
00:41:43,103 --> 00:41:45,236
And after that, we briefly connect the Mac.

631
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:48,702
(Film: Hey Giovanni, you're due today!)

632
00:41:50,236 --> 00:41:51,002
(Film: See you soon!)

633
00:41:53,502 --> 00:41:55,635
How do I get rid of this?

634
00:41:56,269 --> 00:41:59,502
I want this gone folks...

635
00:41:59,502 --> 00:42:03,335
Now how does this go... Ah okay now!

636
00:42:04,602 --> 00:42:05,235
So!

637
00:42:06,735 --> 00:42:07,435
So again briefly...

638
00:42:07,435 --> 00:42:10,335
Now I turn off the light again.

639
00:42:11,568 --> 00:42:15,434
So that's it now... Now he'll do a new keystone check...

640
00:42:15,434 --> 00:42:17,401
If he notices, something has changed!

641
00:42:18,034 --> 00:42:21,434
Do a keystone check and of course it might not be ideal

642
00:42:21,434 --> 00:42:25,600
if you're watching the film and then turn on the light...

643
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,334
Well...

644
00:42:29,334 --> 00:42:32,933
But definitely: the format is right! 16 to 9

645
00:42:33,567 --> 00:42:39,566
Everything looks good...

646
00:42:44,233 --> 00:42:45,799
But here you can also see...

647
00:42:45,799 --> 00:42:51,799
The sound comes through the laptop and the picture is delayed.

648
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:56,832
That's why the synchronization between sound and picture is not correct here.

649
00:42:59,032 --> 00:43:02,465
That means the sound always comes a little before the picture...

650
00:43:08,465 --> 00:43:09,631
Yes, we'll do that soon!

651
00:43:10,365 --> 00:43:11,931
I'll finish this so quickly now.

652
00:43:11,931 --> 00:43:13,731
I'll finish this as soon as possible!

653
00:43:13,731 --> 00:43:14,798
OK.

654
00:43:14,798 --> 00:43:15,698
So and now...

655
00:43:15,698 --> 00:43:19,064
Just turn it off completely and then the picture looks really great!

656
00:43:19,331 --> 00:43:23,331
So you have to say! Can't you really say anything, now we just have to adjust the sound,

657
00:43:24,197 --> 00:43:27,164
then I would be satisfied...

658
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:31,830
So now let's try the Mac, maybe we can get the sound over there...

659
00:43:33,697 --> 00:43:37,263
So short, short cut!

660
00:43:37,263 --> 00:43:40,463
The MacBook Pro...

661
00:43:42,296 --> 00:43:44,430
The Apple Alternative!

662
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:46,763
Again with USB-C.

663
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:50,563
And he notices it again right away...

664
00:43:50,563 --> 00:43:54,029
Do we have a picture of you...

665
00:43:58,262 --> 00:44:00,529
Yes, looks good, picture is there!

666
00:44:01,162 --> 00:44:02,795
That makes me happy!

667
00:44:03,162 --> 00:44:06,295
Ah yes, now I wanted to change the display for a moment.

668
00:44:07,628 --> 00:44:11,128
So...

669
00:44:11,328 --> 00:44:13,562
And then we'll see...

670
00:44:14,095 --> 00:44:15,528
Here again “confidential”.

671
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:17,228
I didn't want to go there!

672
00:44:17,428 --> 00:44:19,728
Oh, I was just about to do that right.

673
00:44:22,061 --> 00:44:23,594
So, how do I get here now...

674
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,894
I really just want a new window here...

675
00:44:26,761 --> 00:44:29,094
Is this possible here? Well ...

676
00:44:29,094 --> 00:44:33,360
www.holzheu.de

677
00:44:33,494 --> 00:44:34,527
And then we'll see...

678
00:44:34,527 --> 00:44:37,794
Oh yes, with the sound we can see straight away whether it has taken over

679
00:44:37,794 --> 00:44:40,327
the HDMI or not.

680
00:44:40,327 --> 00:44:42,793
Now he's doing Keystone again, why?

681
00:44:57,059 --> 00:45:00,959
He is now giving it back

682
00:45:01,392 --> 00:45:04,092
to the Mac with a corresponding delay.

683
00:45:04,426 --> 00:45:09,725
And for some reason...

684
00:45:09,725 --> 00:45:13,525
For some reason you can...

685
00:45:14,492 --> 00:45:16,725
Ah yes! Here you can now play the sound...

686
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:21,891
Here you can now actually output the sound

687
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:24,458
on the

688
00:45:25,324 --> 00:45:27,358
projector.

689
00:45:31,191 --> 00:45:33,957
A bit noisy for the neighbor!

690
00:45:34,191 --> 00:45:38,290
And I can't turn it down here either, from the Control Center, but...

691
00:45:41,057 --> 00:45:43,757
I have to do that somehow here with the...

692
00:45:43,757 --> 00:45:47,957
with the remote control, but how do I get it quieter now?

693
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,790
How can I make it quieter now?

694
00:45:56,789 --> 00:45:58,789
And it actually doesn't sound right now...

695
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:05,689
It actually sounds a little bit better on the MacBook Pro.

696
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:10,289
The question is, how do I get it quieter now... Ah yes here!

697
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:14,489
Ah yes, yes, that's the volume down button: down, volume down.

698
00:46:15,089 --> 00:46:20,722
Up, louder.

699
00:46:20,722 --> 00:46:24,788
And indeed it sounds a little less full,

700
00:46:27,255 --> 00:46:28,588
than on...

701
00:46:28,588 --> 00:46:30,721
the MacBook, at least I think so!

702
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:33,454
Now let's briefly switch back and forth in comparison...

703
00:46:38,287 --> 00:46:42,654
Well, the MacBook definitely has more bass.

704
00:46:45,254 --> 00:46:46,154
Yes.

705
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:52,920
Then I think that

706
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,820
's enough for a first impression!

707
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:59,186
I would summarize...

708
00:47:00,286 --> 00:47:01,453
Fan...

709
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,686
Put me in front of the camera for the summary.

710
00:47:07,352 --> 00:47:12,019
So if you compare that to the ViewSonic...

711
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:14,952
The fan, the fan is better, much quieter...

712
00:47:16,219 --> 00:47:18,585
It seems more intuitive to use.

713
00:47:19,552 --> 00:47:22,318
What I found worse was the

714
00:47:23,985 --> 00:47:25,718
delay, i.e. the delay.

715
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:28,018
It must have been two...

716
00:47:29,051 --> 00:47:31,851
milliseconds maybe or...

717
00:47:31,851 --> 00:47:35,384
No, a millisecond is a thousandth of a second...

718
00:47:35,384 --> 00:47:37,218
I would say it was 0.2 seconds!

719
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:38,718
0.2... 0.1...

720
00:47:38,718 --> 00:47:41,284
0.1 seconds maybe delay, guess.

721
00:47:42,917 --> 00:47:44,984
Colors and such look good.

722
00:47:45,017 --> 00:47:47,650
Brightness sufficient for the size I think.

723
00:47:49,484 --> 00:47:52,283
So we then played the YouTube video

724
00:47:53,317 --> 00:47:57,950
through the PC and through the MacBook, which worked well.

725
00:47:58,816 --> 00:48:01,516
You couldn't play any sound

726
00:48:01,516 --> 00:48:05,116
on the Windows PC , for whatever reason.

727
00:48:05,516 --> 00:48:07,216
So on the

728
00:48:07,483 --> 00:48:08,983
projector

729
00:48:09,883 --> 00:48:12,682
and otherwise it's a bit

730
00:48:12,949 --> 00:48:20,415
more compact, doesn't get overly hot here either, that's okay!

731
00:48:20,415 --> 00:48:24,115
Looks nice!

732
00:48:24,115 --> 00:48:27,315
So I guess you can keep it.

733
00:48:28,482 --> 00:48:30,748
So sufficient for my purposes.

734
00:48:32,148 --> 00:48:35,215
And...

735
00:48:35,215 --> 00:48:36,215
yes, then...

736
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:39,814
let's see how it works...

737
00:48:40,848 --> 00:48:43,947
in the project.

738
00:48:43,947 --> 00:48:45,147
Yes, then...

739
00:48:48,914 --> 00:48:50,747
you just have to learn

740
00:48:50,747 --> 00:48:53,880
how to speak Chinese.

741
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,547
So this...

742
00:48:56,147 --> 00:49:00,180
Forgot how to pronounce XGIMI again.

743
00:49:00,547 --> 00:49:01,047
Hm.
